      <p>
        I spent four years in the US Marine Corps, where I served with 1st Bn, 4th Marines in San Diego, CA. There, I had the honor
        of serving as a Mortars squad leader, supervising and directing the personal, professional, and tactical development of my Marines.
        I also served a secondary role as a Defense Travel systems respresentative, where I managed DTS claims from Marines in my company,
        ensuring they were paid accurately and on time.

        After my time in service, I went to study at UMN Duluth. There, I was a member of both Bulldog Rocketry, working with the Avionics and 
        and Technology Committee. I also was a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon - Upsilon Gamma Chapter, serving as president.
